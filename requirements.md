if it doesn't contact a maintainer and tell them about this issue.

- install all packages

```sh
    npm i --include=dev
```

- do the following command when doing the first push


setting orgin and creating the branch
```sh
    git checkout -b your-username
    git remote add origin https://github.com/Stacs-nssce/Stacs-website/tree/your-branch-name
```

adding yourself into the contributors file
```sh
    echo "- [your name](your github profile link)" >> contributors.md
```

staging and committing the changes you made to the repo
```sh
    npm run add
    git commit -m "initial push"
```

Setting the push orgin to the branch you created
```sh
    git push --set-upstream origin {your username}
```

This does not need to be done after the above steps, but instead after you've made more changes.
After you've completed all these steps you can continue to push updates normally after making changes with
```sh
    npm run add
    git commit -m "Information about your commit"
    git push
```

as your origin is set to your branch now!!
